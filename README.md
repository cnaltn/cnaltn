My name is Can Altun. I am a driven and motivated individual with a passion for technology and software development. I am currently a last-year Computer Engineer student at Erciyes University, where I have been honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in the realm of full-stack development.

With over 3 years of experience in front-end development and 1.5 years in back-end development, I possess a deep understanding of a range of technologies, including ReactJs, NodeJs, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, MongoDB, Firebase, and more.
